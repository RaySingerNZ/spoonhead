This NYE I had the pleasure of playing at AUM festival, which was about an hour north of Auckland on a beautiful piece of land nestled between the Kaipara Harbour and the Tasman Sea.
I'd been hearing about these parties for a few years but was not prepared for just how good it was going to be. The music was solid, there was swimming, great food, hilarious conversations and even hot showers and flushing toilets on site! Not your average bush doof that's for sure.

The crew up in Auckland are amazing and I can't thank them enough for getting me on board! Wicked times were had by all.
