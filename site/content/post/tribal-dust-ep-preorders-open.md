Hey crew! Welcome to the Pre-Order for the Tribal Dust E.P.

The title track Tribal Dust is a super tribal progressive number with huge percussion and ethnic sounds, it ends with some lush natural recordings of a Ruru in the NZ native bush. 

The second track Dragon's Dinner a seriously chunky, darker track with twisted natural sounds, spacious reverb and some cool quirks. This track keeps with the tribal theme but gets really driving towards the end. 

The final track Tribal Dust (Transcenic Remix) is a deep tribal house take on the title track. Again with huge percussion but this time using an interesting take on delay and feedback. This makes for great progression across the length of the track. 

If you'd like to help me to realise this tribal vision then I invite you to support this pre-order. This pre-order will help to fund the audio mastering. 

By supporting the pre-order you get the tracks at a discount rate - only $3 - plus I'm throwing in two extra tracks for free that you can download right away! The first bonus track is my remix of Pspiralife's 'An Altered State Of Conciousness'. This remix takes the track on a unique journey with soulful strings and a triplet bassline. The second bonus track is my remix of Jekyll's 'Mind Edge'. Again this remix sticks with the triplet theme and can be a great mixing companion for the Pspiralife remix. 

Thanks I'm really looking forward to bringing these tracks to your world!
