Hey crew! Welcome to the Tribal Dust E.P.

The title track Tribal Dust is a super tribal progressive number with huge percussion and ethnic sounds, it ends with some lush natural recordings of a Ruru in the NZ native bush. 

The second track Dragon's Dinner a seriously chunky, darker track with twisted natural sounds, spacious reverb and some cool quirks. This track keeps with the tribal theme but gets really driving towards the end. 

The final track Tribal Dust (Transcenic Remix) is a deep tribal house take on the title track. Again with huge percussion but this time using an interesting take on delay and feedback. This makes for great progression across the length of the track.
