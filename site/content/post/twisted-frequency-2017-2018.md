After an awesome time at AUM Festival I took a flight to Nelson to play at the infamous Twisted Frequency Festival. This festival was tucked deep into native bush in Golden Bay in the South Island of New Zealand.
I was a little worried about the weather and as I arrived the clouds moved in and rain came down. But that didn't stop a whole bunch of great crew getting absolutely wild during my set. I was blown away by the response to my new music and am super excited about these upcoming releases!

Some seriously good times where had at this festival. I made a new soul brother - Paul from Bass to Pain Converter. What an absolute champion. I also had the fortune to catch Tribone's set. Woah. That's some next level gear!
